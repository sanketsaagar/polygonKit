## Getting a Project ID

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create WalletConnect Account">
    Visit [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com) and sign up for a free account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Project">
    Click "New Project" and fill in your project details:
    - **Project Name**: Your app's name
    - **Homepage URL**: Your app's URL (can be localhost for development)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Project ID">
    Once created, you'll see your Project ID on the dashboard. Copy this ID.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to Environment Variables">
    Store your Project ID in environment variables (never commit this to version control):

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Next.js">
        ```bash .env.local
        NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Vite">
        ```bash .env
        VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Remix">
        ```bash .env
        VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure PolygonKit">
    Pass your Project ID to the PolygonKitProvider:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Next.js">
        ```tsx
        <PolygonKitProvider
          config={{
            projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID,
          }}
        >
          <App />
        </PolygonKitProvider>
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Vite">
        ```tsx
        <PolygonKitProvider
          config={{
            projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID,
          }}
        >
          <App />
        </PolygonKitProvider>
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Remix">
        ```tsx
        <PolygonKitProvider
          config={{
            projectId: process.env.VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID,
          }}
        >
          <App />
        </PolygonKitProvider>
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Always use environment variables for your Project ID. Never hardcode it in your source code or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Default Project ID

PolygonKit includes a default Project ID for quick development:

```typescript
projectId: 'f6bd6e2911b56f5ac3bc8b2d0e2d7ad5'
```

<Warning>
  The default Project ID is for **development only**. You must create your own Project ID for production applications. The default ID may be rate-limited or revoked.
</Warning>

## WalletConnect Features

### Wallet Selection Modal

PolygonKit automatically shows a wallet selection modal when users click the connect button:

```tsx
import { ConnectWallet } from '@sanketsaagar/polygon-kit';

function App() {
  return <ConnectWallet />;
}
```

The modal includes:
- Search functionality
- Popular wallets highlighted
- QR code for mobile wallet connection
- "View All" to see 300+ supported wallets

### QR Code Connection

Desktop users can scan QR codes to connect with mobile wallets:

1. Click "WalletConnect" in the modal
2. Scan the QR code with your mobile wallet app
3. Approve the connection in your wallet
4. Connection established!

### Mobile Deep Linking

On mobile devices, PolygonKit automatically opens wallet apps:

1. Tap a wallet in the connection modal
2. The wallet app opens automatically
3. Approve the connection
4. Return to your app - you're connected!

## Customizing Wallet Modal

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the wallet modal through the PolygonKitProvider configuration:

```tsx
<PolygonKitProvider
  config={{
    projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
    appName: 'My Polygon App',
    appDescription: 'Connect your wallet to get started',
    appUrl: 'https://myapp.com',
    appIcons: ['https://myapp.com/logo.png'],
  }}
>
  <App />
</PolygonKitProvider>
```

These values appear in:
- The wallet connection modal
- The wallet app when requesting approval
- WalletConnect session details

## Project Analytics

WalletConnect Cloud provides analytics for your project:

- **Active Users**: Number of connected wallets
- **Connection Events**: How many times users connect
- **Wallet Distribution**: Which wallets users prefer
- **Geographic Data**: Where your users are located

Access analytics at: https://cloud.walletconnect.com

WalletConnect Cloud has rate limits based on your plan:

| Plan | Requests/Month |
|------|----------------|
| Free | 1,000,000 |
| Pro | 10,000,000+ |

The free tier is sufficient for most applications. Upgrade if you need higher limits.

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Project ID Error

**Problem**: "Invalid Project ID" error when connecting wallet.

**Solution**:
1. Verify your Project ID is correct
2. Check that environment variables are loaded properly
3. Ensure the Project ID hasn't been revoked
4. Create a new Project ID if needed

### Wallet Not Appearing in Modal

**Problem**: A specific wallet doesn't show up in the connection modal.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure the wallet supports WalletConnect v2
2. Check if the wallet is installed (for browser extension wallets)
3. Try searching for the wallet by name in the modal
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### QR Code Not Working

**Problem**: QR code doesn't connect with mobile wallet.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure your Project ID is valid
2. Check that the wallet app supports WalletConnect v2
3. Try a different wallet app
4. Verify your internet connection is stable

### Connection Drops Frequently

**Problem**: Wallet connection drops after a short time.

**Solution**:
1. Check if you're hitting rate limits
2. Upgrade your WalletConnect plan if needed
3. Ensure proper session management in your app
4. Verify network stability

### Rate Limit Errors

**Problem**: Hitting WalletConnect rate limits.

**Solution**:
1. Monitor your usage in WalletConnect Cloud
2. Optimize connection logic to reduce unnecessary requests
3. Upgrade to a paid plan for higher limits
4. Implement caching to reduce API calls

## Example: Connection Handler

Handle connection events and errors:

```tsx
import { ConnectWallet, usePolygonKit } from '@sanketsaagar/polygon-kit';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function WalletConnection() {
  const { isConnected, address } = usePolygonKit();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isConnected) {
      console.log('Wallet connected:', address);
      // Track analytics, show welcome message, etc.
    }
  }, [isConnected, address]);

  const handleConnect = () => {
    console.log('Opening wallet connection modal...');
  };

  const handleError = (error: Error) => {
    console.error('Connection error:', error);
    // Show user-friendly error message
  };

  return (
    <ConnectWallet
      onConnect={handleConnect}
      onError={handleError}
    />
  );
}
```

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  - Never share your Project ID publicly in blog posts or screenshots
  - Use environment variables to store your Project ID
  - Rotate your Project ID if it's been compromised
  - Enable notifications in WalletConnect Cloud for security alerts
</Warning>
