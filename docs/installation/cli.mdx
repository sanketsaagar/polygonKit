## The Fastest Way to Get Started

The `create-polygon-kit` CLI is the easiest way to scaffold a new PolygonKit project. It sets up everything you need with pre-configured templates for Next.js or Vite.

<Note>
  **Recommended**: This is the fastest way to start building with PolygonKit. Your project will be ready in under a minute!
</Note>

## Quick Start

Create a new PolygonKit project with a single command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx create-polygon-kit my-app
```

```bash yarn
yarn create polygon-kit my-app
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm create polygon-kit my-app
```

```bash bun
bunx create-polygon-kit my-app
```

</CodeGroup>

Or run without a project name to be prompted:

```bash
npx create-polygon-kit
```

## Interactive Setup

The CLI will guide you through an interactive setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Project Name">
    First, you'll be asked to name your project (if you didn't provide it):

    ```
    ? What is your project named? › my-polygon-app
    ```

    The CLI will check if the directory already exists and prevent overwriting.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Framework">
    Select your preferred framework:

    ```
    ? Which framework would you like to use?
    ❯ Next.js - React framework with SSR
      Vite - Fast build tool with HMR
    ```

    Both options come with:
    - Full TypeScript support
    - Pre-configured PolygonKit components
    - Wallet connection with WalletConnect
    - TailwindCSS v4 for styling
    - Pre-built dashboard UI
  </Step>

  <Step title="TypeScript Configuration">
    Choose whether to use TypeScript:

    ```
    ? Would you like to use TypeScript? › (Y/n)
    ```

    We recommend using TypeScript for the best development experience with full type safety.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Decide if you want to install dependencies immediately:

    ```
    ? Install dependencies now? › (Y/n)
    ```

    If you choose "Yes", the CLI will automatically run `npm install` for you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Structure

After running the CLI, your project will have this structure:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Next.js">
    ```
    my-polygon-app/
    ├── app/
    │   ├── layout.tsx          # Root layout with providers
    │   ├── page.tsx            # Main page with dashboard
    │   ├── providers.tsx       # Client-side providers
    │   └── globals.css         # Global styles
    ├── public/
    ├── package.json
    ├── tsconfig.json
    ├── tailwind.config.ts
    └── next.config.js
    ```

    The Next.js template uses the App Router with server and client components properly configured.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Vite">
    ```
    my-polygon-app/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── App.tsx             # Main app with dashboard
    │   ├── main.tsx            # Entry point with providers
    │   ├── App.css             # Component styles
    │   └── index.css           # Global styles with Tailwind

## Troubleshooting

### Directory Already Exists

If you see "Directory already exists" error:

```bash
# Choose a different name
npx create-polygon-kit my-new-app-name

# Or remove the existing directory
rm -rf my-polygon-app
npx create-polygon-kit my-polygon-app
```

### Dependency Installation Failed

If automatic installation fails:

```bash
cd my-polygon-app
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Template Not Found

If you see "Template not found" error, ensure you're using the latest version:

```bash
npx create-polygon-kit@latest my-app
```

### Port Already in Use

If the default port is already in use:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Next.js">
    ```bash
    # Next.js will automatically try the next available port
    npm run dev

    # Or specify a custom port
    PORT=3001 npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Vite">
